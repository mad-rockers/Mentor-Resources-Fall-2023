# Mentor-Resources-Fall-2023
Contains resources for the Software Engineering mentor developed during the Fall 2023 off-season. 

## Small_Robot is a project for the late 2023 off-season. It consists of a Mecanum Drive Train and a Limelight Camera. 
Spotless has been added to build.gradle:
- builds will fail if your code does not adhere to the Google Java Style Guide
- use `gradlew :spotlessApply` to automatically format files

This project includes `LimelightHelpers.java`
- This is a helper library for the Limelight Camera
- At this time, the library is available for use, but it has not been incorperated in the CameraSubsystem
